// This is a login page that is in desperate need of some UX work.
// Using principles of modern design, rewrite this login page.
// Be sure to consider user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

// You may change any HTML, CSS, or JS that you choose, but you MAY NOT import a CSS
// library. We want to test your own styling ability! You may take influence from
// a CSS library, but no copy pasting!

// You may import a font if you think it will benefit the page, but no other
// external resources are allowed.

// Your solution will be judged using the following criteria:
// - appearance
// - design
// - user experience (is your solution easy to use or hard?)
// - code quality
