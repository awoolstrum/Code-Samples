# Code-Samples

## 1. Steam SSO

Over the last 8 years, I have been building a private PHP framework for my hobby projects. This is an example of code that I added to my Single Source Sign-on (SSO) modules using the Steam interface.  This code is included to illustrate OOP principles (with some exceptions in the SteamApplication; as SSO necessitates a certain amount of procedural code) and my coding style.

## 2. JSON API specification utility

On development teams where the front end and back end responsibilities are split, it's important to have API specifications so that data is always passed and returned in a predictable data structure. PHP League's Fractal library is one solution to that problem. However, I found a use case that didn't neatly fit into the library, so I built a simple utility that extended the Fractal resources.  Please find that library here:

## 3. Coding Exercises

These are code samples from exercises for previous employment tests. In each exercise, specific instructions were given, and the code was generated under time pressure.  I have not modified the code from that timed exercise, so you that you can see what I am able to produce under a deadline.
