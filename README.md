# Code-Samples

## 1. Steam SSO

Over the last 8 years, I have been building a private PHP framework for my hobby projects. This is an example of code that I added to my Single Source Sign-on (SSO) modules using the Steam interface.  This code is included to illustrate OOP principles (with some exceptions in the SteamApplication; as SSO necessitates a certain amount of procedural code) and my coding style.

## 2. Coding Exercises

These are code samples from exercises for previous employment tests. In each exercise, specific instructions were given, and the code was generated under time pressure.  I have not modified the code from that timed exercise, so you that you can see what I am able to produce under a deadline.
